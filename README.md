### Introduction

The National Weather Service XML Display Tool, or NWS XML Display Tool, is capable of importing and viewing current observation XML files from the National Weather Service.

This tool was created with Python version 3.12.3. The Linux version of IDLE 3.12.3 is/was used for development and testing.

### Required Modules

This tool makes use of the following modules:

- Tkinter
- PIL
- xml.etree.ElementTree


### Where to Get Current Observation Files

To download a ZIP file containing over 5,000 current observation XML files from the National Weather Service, visit https://forecast.weather.gov/xml/current_obs and select "All current XML files" (the ZIP file is usually ~4 MB; ~9 MB once extracted).

Direct link: https://forecast.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/all_xml.zip


### As of version 0.11.1:

All NWS Current Observation XML files *should* now open without issue. The "Open Forecast XML File" button is merely a placeholder at this time, as the viewing of NWS Forecast XML files has not been implemented yet. Planned features and ideas for future versions are now noted in the new "TO DO" section of the file.

### Future Release Plans

This tool was originally developed for a final project in a college class that I had to take. Since then, I have continued to work on this tool here and there. I would love to "finish" this tool in the future, but please note that I may consider rewriting this tool in a different language at some point.

### Contact

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please contact me on GitHub. I will try to respond as soon as I can.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the National Weather Service for their reliable forecasts and weather information. In addition, I would like to thank my instructor, my classmates, my friends, and my family for their support, suggestions, and ideas.
