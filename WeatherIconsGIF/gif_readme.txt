The graphics included in this folder (except for "unavailable.gif", which was created by me) were taken from the National Weather Service page, "New Forecast-at-a-Glance icons" (https://www.weather.gov/forecast-icons).

The weather graphic icons were originally PNGs, but due to limitations with Python's Image and ImageTk modules, they were converted to GIFs. Please note that this may change with future releases of this tool.

Unless otherwise noted, I do not claim ownership of the graphics contained within this folder, nor have I created them. They are used strictly for the purpose of displaying the appropriate weather graphics with the appropriate weather conditions. When viewing an NWS XML file, the usage of the NWS/NOAA logo is there to help identify the nature and source of the information found within the XML files.

This tool uses these graphics for informational purposes only.

In addition, links to PNG versions of these graphics are usually referenced in NWS XML files. When viewing NWS XML files online, the appropriate graphics are usually visible within the browser's viewport. As of version 0.11.1 of this tool, XML files can only be viewed by locally importing them into the tool, making the inclusion of these graphics necessary.
