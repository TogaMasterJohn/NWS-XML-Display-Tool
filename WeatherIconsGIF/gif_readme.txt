These graphics were taken from the National Weather Service page, "New Forecast-at-a-Glance icons".

They were originally PNGs, but due to limitations with Python's Image and ImageTk modules, they were 
converted to GIFs for the purpose of displaying the appropriate weather graphic with the appropriate 
weather conditions.

According to the "Disclaimer" on the National Weather Service's website, these graphics are in the public
domain, as they were available on their web server (as well as their website). All information on the 
National Weather Service's website, unless otherwise stated or noted, is public domain.

This program uses these weather graphics for non-commercial, educational, and informational purposes 
only.

I do not claim ownership of these weather graphics, nor have I created these weather graphics.
